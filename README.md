python scripts to automate some stuff

## email_to_csv.py

This is bot for my specific use case. It reads highlights that I have emailed myslef from apple books and converts them into csv file.
It requires additional step to copy paste email in [this](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/text-to-html/) website and then create a dummy html file. 
Save dummy file in same folder as script.
If all this is correct then run the script.
`python email_to_csv.py <HTML-File-name>`
*for some reason I was not able to run this using python 3 in my local so I had to use python 2 syntax*
